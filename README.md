# Computer Vision RPS
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors.
Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.
The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.
This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

# AiCore
This is the 2nd project of my AiCore Journey.

# What I learned
Create a teachable machine model that recognises different hand signals for the game.
How tools like machine learning can be used to supplement projects such as these and take them to the next level.
How to set up environment, set up necessary packages, troubleshoot problems with python versions not being compaticle with packages etc
